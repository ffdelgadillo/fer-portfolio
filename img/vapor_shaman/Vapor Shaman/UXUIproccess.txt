VAPE APP GENERAL INFORMATION
Vapor Shaman is a small vaping company with a store located in the city of Aguascalientes and also an online store. The main purpose of a vape (also known as e-cigarette, electronic cigarette or vaporizer) is to encourage smokers to quit it once since for all, while enjoying all the vaping fun features. The most important thing is to make a friendly user app with an intuitive interface resulting in a great user experience covering all the user needs, therefore aesthetics come in to a second term. The app comes in a free version and in a $4-dollar lifetime membership.
“Cigarette smoking is a powerful risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Tar in cigarettes coats the lungs and can cause lung and throat cancer in smokers.”
There are 3 main user targets that need to be covered:
1.	Beginner Smoker:  Usually this type of smoker starts out at a young age seeing it as something cool and tries to fit in a social group. There are also post-traumatic experiences that lead to this sort of conduct.
2.	Intermediate Smoker: For this type of smoker, smoking can become connected to other activities of the day-to-day life—like watching TV, talking on the phone, hanging out with friends, going certain places, or taking a break to relax. Then smoking becomes a part of a pattern or routine.
3.	Long Term Smoker: This type of smoker passed through the beginner and intermediate phase/level a long time ago. He/she has even forgotten when they started out. They are always in need for smoking because of their mood swings or just for habit and pleasure. Quitting is hard for this people but there are many cases of success due to turning points such as health problems or interpersonal situations (death of a close friend or family).

Many people smoke because it’s a way they’ve learned to cope with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, negative moods, and the stress of daily life. There are ways to deal with emotions without smoking. Counseling can teach you ways to cope, and getting support from loved ones can help, too. Therefore, Vapor Shaman wants to help all types of smokers by providing a new alternative for quitting.



1.	RESEARCH
Stakeholder: Aguascalientes Health Department
Business Objective: Vapor Shaman is a small business located in the city of Aguascalientes. The main objective is to reach out to smokers in the state. At the same time, they want to sell the app and get the necessary diffusion from the health department (SSE) so they increase both in clients and sales. The benefit the government is receiving is an app to encourages young and old people to quit smoking by contributing to a health issue in the state.
Vaping it's a luxury hobby, so the main idea is to get the right diffusion while the health department can provide the community constant special offers to shop in the local Vape Shaman store. The health department needs to be convinced that this app provides all the necessary information. To achieve this, the app needs to be user friendly while providing all the department needs for its funding. 

2.	STRATEGY
The Health Department wants information by doing field research with people who smoke at any level and people who have smoked.
Here are some of the main questions (amongst others) that need to be asked to get to know better the people that smoke in the state.
1.	How old are you?
2.	What age did you try your first cigarette?
3.	How long have you been smoking?
4.	Why did you start smoking?
5.	Have you tried to stop smoking?
6.	If so, what alternatives have you used?
7.	Have any of these alternatives helped?
8.	How many cigarettes do you smoke on a daily-basis?
9.	Which days do you smoke the most?
10.	If we can provide a new alternative would you consider it?
11.	Do you know the health problems it causes?
RESULTS
For the survey 1,000 people were interviewed:
In Aguascalientes, 47% of the population claims to have used cigarettes at some time in their lives, according to a study by Vapor Shaman staff members, which presents information from the latest housing survey on knowledge and consumption of tobacco in Aguascalientes.


But the most serious is the age of onset of consumption: the average age to start smoking is 13 years. 25% of respondents said that the first time they smoked was between 10 and 14 years, while the majority (42%) said they started using tobacco between 15 and 17 years. According to the staff members, the State of Aguascalientes is the entity with a high percentage of people (14.3%), between 10 and 19 years old, who have smoked more than 100 cigars. 
 
Regarding the health problems it causes, most of the people surveyed said that tobacco smoking causes respiratory diseases and addiction. While half did not know that it causes sexual impotence, blindness and bone damage. 
3.	COMPETITION
For this information 100 persons were interviewed with the following questions, so they could talk about the current vaping stores.
1.	What do you think about these stores? 
2.	Do these stores provide information about vaping?
3.	What do you think about their pricing on products?
4.	Do any of these stores give special offers?
5.	What do you think of their service?
In Aguascalientes there are only 2 stores associated with the selling of vaping products. Both stores don’t have any sort of website or app that includes information for vaping and all there is to learn, on the contrary they use social media as their platform, but only for selling products. As many consumer posts on their social media a lot of people ask a lot of questions regarding, liquids, equipment and accessories. Focusing on the questions that were read, not too many get a quick response or none. Both stores lack of providing sufficient information.



Name of the competition:
1.	La Vaperia: Small business, pioneer on selling vaping equipment in the state. Having asked the previous questions, here are the results (based on general opinions):
a.	This store provides medium to advanced equipment.
b.	Not a lot of information is given, they sometimes give you some basic answers, but they seem more focused on selling than helping their customers.
c.	In general, the prices are ok, there are some products that are cheaper to buy on the internet, but I don’t usually buy products online.
d.	Special offers are very limited, they only have 2 seasons offering medium level discounts.
e.	The service given it’s regular, not the best since they are more focused on selling, you don’t feel connected even though you are coming at least 1-2 times a week.

2.	VaXti: Another small vaping store, doesn’t have a lot of time in the state.
a.	This store provides a lot of vaping merchandise.
b.	None, they don’t have a website and don’t have the right diffusion on social media.
c.	Prices are great, most of the products are on point according on how they should be selled. 
d.	As “La Vaperia” this store has the same season special offers, but they do offer random promotions throughout all months (buy 3 get one free, buy this mod and get batteries free).
e.	Service is great, the people that run this place make you feel real comfortable. On the other hand, a big problem is that they close too early since the store is in “El Agropecuario” which is a big food and misc. market that closes at 5p.m. so not many people can get there for several reasons.

Taking this in consideration Vapor Shaman can work out all the problems and take advantage on the weak points of these stores and also having a big plus by providing a mobile app where they can get all the information at any time.
Points that need to be covered to compete against these stores:
a.	Have a respectable medium to high merchandise
b.	Provide all the necessary information, via social media, website and off course a mobile app.
c.	Have a general standard for pricing not too high to scare customers nor to low so the store can have a profit.
d.	Give a lot of special offers throughout the year (Health Department is a key for this point).
e.	Always provide a great service, make this a motto so the customers feel accepted and giving them a great user experience.
